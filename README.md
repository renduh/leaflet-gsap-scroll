# Sherlock Holmes and the case of the leaflet map interactive scrolling web page

I wanted to see how simple it could be to make an scrollytelling page with a leaflet map flying to different locations. I also wanted to make the leaflet map have a dark theme without paying for expensive tilesets.

I think this has worked out pretty well. It's just a simple greyscale and invert filter on the map with a hue-rotation on the marks to turn them from blue to red.

I remember seeing a scrolling map site doing Sherlock Holmes locations ages ago so I thought that would be more interesting than just lorum ipsuming the content so I got AI to come up with a list of locations and some words to go with each. So here we go...
